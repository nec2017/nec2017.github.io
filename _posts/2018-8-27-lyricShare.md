<center>NOW HEAR DIS!</center>
<center>This one is dedicated to all those who complete dem Offsec certifications,</center>

<center>di ones who nah falter who nah waiver,</center>
<center>di ones who try harder and get braver!
<center>Ya must not FAIL, 
<center>ya must not make it a BUST,
<center>Try Harder you MUST!
<center>CHORUS

<center>Offsec Say Try Harder!
<center>Only way to get your OSCP
<center>You must try harder, harder than you can believe
<center>Cause that’s the Offsec Philosophy! X 2

<center>Banging ya head against di desk
<center>Can’t believe ya in such a mess
<center>six foot deep inside a Offsec Penetration Test
<center>While ya tunnel and ya pivot, hit the dirt like a divot
<center>Pain and Sufferance boy you mi say you know it and you live it!
<center>But you must break yourself past your own perceived limits
<center>When ya want to throw in the towel, just say f’ it and just quit it,
<center>Saying Bob, I just don’t get it, the answer mon, what is it?
<center>Him say “Forget it kiddo, Dis is Offsec mon ya must just get with it”.

<center>Do you want to be a giant or do ya want to be a midget,
<center>Ya wanna be Offsec certified or out there developing widgets,
<center>Pick ya head up off and desk put ya fingers on those digits
<center>we got a saying round these parts,
<center>we breathe it and we live it , it goes
<center>CHORUS

<center>Tricia the vicious one she laughing in your face!
<center>You get humbled by the Humble man via cyberspace!
<center>The road a long like marathon not little 50 meter race
<center>Nah wanna crash and no burn no wanna fall from grace!
<center>24 hour test, want put your head pon pillowcase –
<center>But ya can’t quit it now dis ya challenge ya must embrace!
<center>Sit up straight, brush ya teeth with some a dat good old toothpaste
<center>Do some pushups, drink some coffee, splash cold water pan you face….
<center>Then get back inna di game,
<center>So di world can know ya name
<center>That Offsec certification is the hacking hall of fame
<center>There’s no end to the acclaim, so your confidence regain,
<center>You’ve come dis far so to stop now’d just be
<center>one big crying shame

<center>Any doubts you must just drop this
<center>This exam you cannot flop dis
<center>You also cannot stop this so
<center>Like Suey, you must Chop This!
<center>Like a floor you muss mop this!
<center>Like Woodstock you must Rock This!
<center>Buck up, and just try harder.
<center>me telling you, you GOT DIS.

<center>Harder, and harder, and harder and harder…
<center>Life so very short so give it ya all, seh you gotta
<center>This penetration test just a sample of tings fi come
<center>life so very short so inna yours ya must get some and…
<center>CHORUS
